# Data-Science-Model
This project focuses on analyzing the trends in US home prices over the last 20 years by leveraging economic indicators such as interest rates, unemployment rates, and GDP. 
Using publicly available datasets, the project explores the relationship between these indicators and home prices, ultimately building a predictive model.

Project Details:
Datasets Used:
   S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index (CSUSHPISA) â€“ serves as the proxy for home prices.
   Interest Rates (DFF)
   Unemployment Rates (UNRATE)
   GDP Rates (GDP)
Key Features:
   Data cleaning and merging of multiple datasets based on the common Date field.
   Visualization of home prices over time and correlation between economic indicators.
   Linear regression model to predict home prices based on interest rates, unemployment rates, and GDP.
   Evaluation of the model using performance metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
Key Insights:
   Interest rates and home prices show a negative correlation, meaning that lower interest rates tend to drive higher home prices.
   The relationship between GDP and home prices indicates that economic growth supports higher home prices.
   Unemployment rates have an inverse relationship with home prices, reflecting reduced demand during periods of high unemployment.
Model Performance:
   The model was evaluated using a Linear Regression approach and achieved an R-squared value of approximately X%, meaning it explains X% of the variance in home prices.
   The Mean Squared Error (MSE) indicates the average squared difference between predicted and actual home prices.
